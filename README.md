In this chhallenge I created a workday application that can be updated and edited.
The main challenge that I ran into with this project was figuring out how to make 
the times change colors with the current date and time. Stack overflow was a huge 
help when it came to this project alonge with google because some concepts in Jquery 
are difficult to understand like "this". I was able to use "this" in this project after 
countless videos of under standing. The Project git hub and live pages links are below
